# Conduit

Discover why functional languages, such as Elixir, are ideally suited to building applications following the command query responsibility segregation and event sourcing (CQRS/ES) pattern.

Conduit is a blogging platform, an exemplary Medium.com clone, built as a Phoenix web application.

This is the full source code to accompany the "[Building Conduit](https://leanpub.com/buildingconduit)" eBook. 

This book is for anyone who has an interest in CQRS/ES and Elixir. It demonstrates step-by-step how to build an Elixir application implementing the CQRS/ES pattern using the [Commanded](https://github.com/slashdotdash/commanded) open source library.
